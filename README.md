# Cześć! 🇵🇱 in 🇳🇱

I'm deeply passionate about harnessing **AI for medical applications**, with a strong focus on **speech analysis** and **bio-signal processing**.

👩‍🔬 I am currently involved in the [**AUTOMATIC**](https://www.brainlab.pwr.edu.pl/en/sonata-18-programme/) project, where I contribute to developing the **PRSA package** and investigating interpretable correlations between signals to predict **PSH**.

🎓 As a PhD Candidate at **Maastricht University**, I am also working on the [**DACIL**](https://www.nwo.nl/en/projects/kich1gz0321023) project, pushing the boundaries of AI in healthcare.

Let's connect and collaborate on AI-driven solutions for healthcare innovation!
